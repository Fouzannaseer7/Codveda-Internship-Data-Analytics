# 🌸 Task 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris Dataset

This notebook performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the well-known Iris dataset as part of the Codveda Internship. The goal is to understand the structure of the data, detect patterns, and visualize relationships between features.

---

## 📁 Dataset Details

- **Dataset Name:** `iris.csv`
- **Features:**
  - sepal_length
  - sepal_width
  - petal_length
  - petal_width
  - species (target)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and inspect the dataset
- Identify and handle missing or duplicate values
- Generate descriptive statistics (mean, median, etc.)
- Visualize distributions and relationships using:
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Pairplots
  - Correlation heatmap

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **No missing or duplicate data** was found.
- **Petal length and petal width** show strong positive correlation.
- **Setosa** species is easily separable from the others based on petal size.
- **Pairplots and heatmaps** revealed feature interactions useful for classification.

## 🧪 Tools Used

- Python  
- pandas  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📄 File

- `EDA_Iris.ipynb`
