# 💬 Task 3 – Sentiment Analysis using NLP

This notebook demonstrates a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task focused on **sentiment analysis**. The goal is to classify textual data (e.g., reviews or comments) as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** using Python tools like `TextBlob` and `nltk`.

This is part of my submission for the **Codveda Internship – Level 3 (Advanced)**.

## 📁 Dataset Details

- **Dataset Name:** `Sentiment dataset.csv`
- **Column Example:** A text column containing customer reviews or social media comments.
- The dataset was cleaned and analyzed to determine the **polarity and subjectivity** of each text entry.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Preprocess text data:
  - Lowercasing
  - Removing punctuation and stopwords
  - Tokenization and lemmatization
- Perform sentiment analysis using:
  - **TextBlob** for polarity scoring
  - (Optional) `nltk` for text processing
- Visualize results:
  - Sentiment distribution bar chart
  - Word clouds for positive and negative text

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- The majority of the text entries were **positive**, followed by neutral and negative sentiments.
- The most common words in positive reviews reflected customer satisfaction (e.g., "good", "great", "love").
- Word clouds and bar charts provided intuitive summaries of the text data.

## 🧪 Tools Used

- Python  
- pandas  
- TextBlob  
- nltk  
- matplotlib  
- wordcloud
